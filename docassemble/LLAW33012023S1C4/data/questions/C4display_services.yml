# This file contains the blocks to process

# First thing we do is tell Docassemble (or 'declare') the 
# list where we want to store the display list.  This 'object'
# declaration is a little complex.  It is discussed briefly 
# in the C5.03 videos but you don't need to understand 
# this declaration.  Just take it at face value and that
# it works.  That's all you need for this course.

    # when we do the adding part.
