# Contains the questions to be asked in the app
#

# For the Adult/young person question we will ask the person for their age and then
# we'll use a code block to work out whether they're an adult or minor.  We do this 
# because age is a question of fact whereas determining an adult or minor is a 
# question of legal opinion.  Where possible, we should always ask questions of
# fact of our users and let the app make the legal decisions.

# Ask the question...
question: Age

  - Please enter your age: C4age

#  And determine their legal status here

# ATSI status question.
# We ask this as a true/false question in the interests of simplicity.  
# A more sophisticated implementation would
# ask whether a user was Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander,
# neither or preferred not to specify.
# However, our service list only marks a service as True or False with
# regards to catering towards ATSI people so we use this simple question.
# Beacuase we store a true/false as the answer it makes it easier to 
# compare the answer in this variable to the 'indigenous' tag in the 
# service list
question: Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander
subquestion: |
  Do you identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander?
yesno: C4atsi_status

# Accommodation Type
# In this question we present plain English to the user (eg: 'For myself') but
# we store the response as either 'Singles' or 'Families'.  Note that both these 
# values match exactly with the 'accommodation_type' data field in our service list.
# By matching them up now we make it eaiser for ouselves when we need to compare the 
# answer to this question against the values in the service list.
